I forgot who I truly am and became my own stranger.  Joy, once a faithful friend of mine but now forsaken and left to die.     People were never satisfied hence never was I,   People were never happy hence never was I,   People were never proud hence never was I,   People only saw fault and so did I.     It was honorable to give my life for the happiness of others lives,  But it left me with nothing more that honorable affliction, sadness and regret.
