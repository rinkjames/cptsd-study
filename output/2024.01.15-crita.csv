A few months after that I found out I was pregnant again, by a few weeks and aborted again.","The worst event was having intercourse with some guy. The entire night, I was avoiding having sex with him but the situation I was in felt impossible to avoid a sexual encounter. As the night progressed and we were eventually in the room, he tried kissing me and touching me and I was very skeptical as he started undressing me. Eventually I gave in, before intercourse I kept insisting that he wears a condom, and he kept insisting that he was healthy and that he even had evidence of his results. I was slightly intoxicated and hesitantly took his word for it, but I was persistent that he wore a condom, which he eventually did. Mid sex, I think he took the condom off, because things felt a bit different and we were in the dark. The next morning, without warning he started touching me and inserted his penis. I just lay there and did nothing, but after the whole encounter I felt guilty and bad , and just angry with why I let things happen knowing that I was uncomfortable with it. I thought of going to the doctor to get a rape kit or some form of testing , but I kept trying to downplay the situation and eventually didn't go.

He would sit outside in the garden and throw soil on his head and 'repent' and believe that he is a bad human and will go to hell.
